# Howl3D
A free and open-source program for converting 2D videos to 3D.

⚠️ **Extremely WIP** ⚠️

While Howl3D can currently produce 3D output from videos successfully, it has not nearly reached a state where I would recommend its usage. I've created this repository for backup purposes and left it public for anyone interested to observe its development progress. The only hardware I possess for development and testing are VITURE AR glasses and an NVIDIA PC, and as such I will be targeting CUDA acceleration and Full Side-By-Side (FSBS) conversion exclusively, at least for now.

This project's name is a not-so-subtle play on another 3D conversion program whose practices I disagree with and which I aim to supply an alternative to. I am aware other 3D conversion programs already exist, but after trying several of them and being dissatisfied one way or another, I decided I want to build my own. After successfully building out a ComfyUI workflow to get the hang of what 3D conversion takes, I've now moved on to learning to write the standalone equivalent and beyond.
